# Proof Assistant

An online platform to enable Logic students to write, verify, store, and share [System L](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_L) style Natural Deduction proofs.  Proofs are checked for correctness in real-time, and provides informative error messages. The project was developed as part of the [Logic4Fun](https://l4f.cecs.anu.edu.au/) initiative during [Logic Summer School](lss.cecs.anu.edu.au), 2015.

## Getting Started


## TODO

* **Documentation**: The code-base has near to none documentation. This is uncharacteristic of me, but the circumstances were such that not spending time for documentation made sense. Now it does not (#7).
* **UX design**: Improve the usability of the interface.

  * Provide a legend to display short-keys for printing logical connectives (#15)
  * Have a dedicated top-level page explaining how-to used the site (#11).

* **Remove Login Wall**: The landing page is a login page. I think this discourages first time visitors from trying out the platform. Maybe there should be a landing page that just jumps right into the proof writing page. 

* **User reCAPTCHA**: Use reCAPTCHA to deter bots from sign-up (#8).
